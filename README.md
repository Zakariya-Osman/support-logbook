# Cloud Support Logbook

This repo documents real-world tech support tasks I completed as part of my journey to becoming a Cloud Support Associate. Each log includes the problem, how I diagnosed it, the steps I took, and the final outcome.

## üîç What's Inside

- Gmail account recovery + 2FA setup
- Google Drive sync troubleshooting
- Wi-Fi connection issues + DNS fixes
- Linux + EC2 basic support tasks
- Password manager setup (Bitwarden)

Each case is stored in its own markdown file under `/logs`.
